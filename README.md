## Hi, I'm Nam! 

My Projects
- [Project 0](https://bnam2103.github.io/VERA-ai/): This project integrates the three models Whisper-large, LLAMA 3.0, and a custom fine-tuned TTS model developed in Project 2 into a real-time conversational AI system. *This project is currently in progress, with planned features including user-specific memory, web-based actions such as search, and Spotify music playback using the user’s Spotify API.*

- [Project 1](https://huggingface.co/spaces/nambn0321/Live_translation_french): This project integrates the three models from Projects 2, 3, and 4 into a real-time speech translation system from spoken French to spoken English.
  
- [Project 2](https://github.com/bnam2103/T5-Text-to-Speech-US-English): Fine-tuned T5 models that can produce speeches with an American accent; there are two models with two different voices. For audio samples from each model, click [here](https://bnam2103.github.io/tts_t5/). For more information and a live demo, click on Project 1.

- [Project 3](https://github.com/bnam2103/Whisper_Small_ASR_french): A fine-tuned Whisper ASR model that can produce transcription given French speeches/audio. Click on Project 2 for more details and a live demo.

- [Project 4](https://github.com/bnam2103/Neural_Machine_Translation_model): A fine-tuned NMT model that can translate French to English precisely. Click on Project 3 for more details and a live demo

- [Project 5](https://github.com/bnam2103/Kaggle_competitions): Kaggle competitions and some of "my best works".

- [Project 6](https://github.com/bnam2103/Exploratory-Data-Analysis): Data Analysis and presentations.
