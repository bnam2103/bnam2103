## Hi, I'm Nam! 

My Projects

- [Project 0](https://huggingface.co/spaces/nambn0321/Live_translation_french): This project integrates the three models from Projects 1, 2, and 3 into a real-time speech translation system. It demonstrates live translation from spoken French to spoken English, which is similar to the multilingual live translation functionality seen in devices like the AirPods Pro 4.
  
- [Project 1](https://github.com/bnam2103/T5-Text-to-Speech-US-English): Fine-tuned T5 models that can produce speeches with an American accent; there are two models with two different voices. For audio samples from each model, click [here](https://bnam2103.github.io/tts_t5/). For more information and a live demo, click on Project 1.

- [Project 2](https://github.com/bnam2103/Whisper_Small_ASR_french): A fine-tuned Whisper ASR model that can produce transcription given French speeches/audio. Click on Project 2 for more details and a live demo.

- [Project 3](https://github.com/bnam2103/Neural_Machine_Translation_model): A fine-tuned NMT model that can translate French to English precisely. Click on Project 3 for more details and a live demo

- [Project 4](https://github.com/bnam2103/Kaggle_competitions): Kaggle competitions and some of "my best works".

- [Project 5](https://github.com/bnam2103/Exploratory-Data-Analysis): Data Analysis and presentations.
