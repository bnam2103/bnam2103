## Hi, I'm Nam! 

My Projects

- [Project 1](https://github.com/bnam2103/T5-Text-to-Speech-US-English): fine-tuned T5 models that can produce speeches with an American Accent; there are two models with two different voices. For audio samples from each model, click [here](https://bnam2103.github.io/tts_t5/). For more information and to use my model live, click on Project 1.

- [Project 2](https://github.com/bnam2103/Kaggle_competitions): Kaggle competitions and some of the projects that I enjoy working on.

- [Project 3](https://huggingface.co/nambn0321/ASR_french_3): A fine-tuned Whisper ASR model that can produce transcription given French speeches/audio. 

Thanks for visiting my profile :D
